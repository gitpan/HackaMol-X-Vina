DESCRIPTION
============
HackaMol::X::Vina provides an interface to AutoDock Vina. This class does not include the AutoDock Vina program, which is 
[released under a very permissive Apache license](http://vina.scripps.edu/manual.html#license), with few restrictions on 
commercial or non-commercial use, or on the derivative works, such is this. Follow these 
[instructions ] (http://vina.scripps.edu/manual.html#installation) to acquire the program. Most importantly, if you use this 
interface effectively, please be sure to cite AutoDock Vina in your work:

O. Trott, A. J. Olson, AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization and multithreading, Journal of Computational Chemistry 31 (2010) 455-461 

Since HackaMol has no pdbqt writing capabilities (yet, HackaMol can read pdbqt files), the user is required to provide those 
files. This is still a work in progress and the API may still change.
